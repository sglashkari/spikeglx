# spikeglx
apbin2ncs reads spike glx binary files and transforms them to Neuralynx csc files (*.ncs)


csv2posp reads tracking CSV files (with time and head direction) and generates pos.p files (pos.p and pos.p.ascii)

Attention:

DLC's CSV file should have at least three column headers: t, x and y. hd is optional.
